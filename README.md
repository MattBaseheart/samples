AUDIO_EFFECTS (Spring 2021)

This is an example of Python programming implementing audio filtering using the SciPy Library. ApplyFX.py is the main code, all other files in this directory are audio testing files.

EQ (Spring 2021)

This is an example of Python programming implementing audio processing using multithreading and a SoX library wrapper. EQ.py is the main code, all other files in this directory are for testing or providing audio files.

LAB 10 (Fall 2019)

This is an example of C programming. SpeedTrap.c is the main file used in the project, all others were used as support code.
This project was run on an Arduino, where external hardware were connected to create a "Speed Trap". 2 Photoresitors sensed the
passing of an object and would calculate the speed of its travel. Corresponding information would be displayed on an LCD 
and an alarm may be played if the maximum speed (set by a rotary encoder) was exceeded. Serial communications using UART
protocol are also allowed from a second Arduino.


MOTOR_CONTROL (Fall 2020)

This is an example of Python programming controlling motors. This folder contains the code developed and a script developed to test
and debug the code. This was done on a Raspberry Pi with two stepper motors attached via shield.

Contact Database (Spring 2020)

This is an example of C++ programming used to manage a database containing non-primitive data types/structures. This code is the work of both myself and a colleague.
