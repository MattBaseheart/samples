LAB 10

This is an example of C programming. SpeedTrap.c is the main file used in the project, all others were used as support code.
This project was run on an Arduino, where external hardware were connected to create a "Speed Trap". 2 Photoresitors sensed the
passing of an object and would calculate the speed of its travel. Corresponding information would be displayed on an LCD 
and an alarm may be played if the maximum speed (set by a rotary encoder) was exceeded. Serial communications using UART
protocol are also allowed from a second Arduino.
